# Using drf-schema-adapter with Ember.js

## Setup

In this cookbook, we will see how to create enpoints from models without
building any frontend yet.

[cc_project_app_drf](https://bitbucket.org/levit_scs/cc_project_app_drf)
which will setup a Django project with a virtualenv and Django REST Framework
pre-installed.

To start with this cookiecutter, you will first need to install
[cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) globally on
your computer if you haven't already done so.

`$ sudo pip install cookiecutter`

Once cookiecutter is installed you can go forward and bootstrap your new project:
